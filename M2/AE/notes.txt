Ontology - determining objects
Machine learning - determining law(s) among objects
Artificial Evolution - doing both above

Note: Time merges from the interaction of particles.

3 rules:
- Cohesion: keep closer "distance" with neighbours
- Alignment: maintainance of similar direction and speed with others
- Avoidance: avoiding neighbours
Rules 1 and 3 are ago-antagonistic.
