abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for ontological engineering with an aim to develop reusable ontologies. The proposed methodology combines experience of developing ontology engineering using a ‘good’ practice with established methodologies and concomitantly implementing reusability in the eSymbiosis ontology.}
