# [Internship] Knowledge formalisation with domain experts "in the loop": new functionnalities for OTTR (Reasonable Ontology Templates)

## Context

Knowledge modelling is the activity of encoding Subject Domain Expert (SME) knowledge so the computer can make sense of it and leverage it for further application. One technology used in this field is the OWL language serialised using RDF triples. For an optimum model quality, ontologists use ontology design patterns which are in general modelling patterns tested and approved. Much like software design patterns are. Recently a research team has proposed a language to implement macros (like functions) describing the triples required to build such ontology design patterns. This project aims at creating an environment to develop using the other language and enhance its capabilities for use in a production environment.

## Description

The broader objective is to implement a knowledge acquisition pipeline. We study Reasonable Ontology Template (OTTR) to define modelling patterns and make it easier for SME's to contribute their knowledge.

## Objective

- Understanding the main component of the W3C semantic stack and their possible applications (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SPARQL)
- Understanding the difference between the Open World Assumption and the Closed World Assumption, and its implications
- Understanding and manipulating the OTTR library
- Developing tools based on OTTR templates to enhance the knowledge acquisition and ontology engineering and maintenance process. The functionalities are to be discussed but should include:
  - Plugging an ontology or a triple store to make the type checking feature of OTTR stronger
  - Link the OTTR expansion process to a triple store and propose advanced features
- Developing a simple web interface to build and manage OTTR templates
- Developing a simple web interface to gather knowledge from domain experts
